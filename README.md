ChatGPT Jailbreaks
A collection of tools and scripts designed to experiment with, analyze, and better understand the inner workings of ChatGPT’s built-in restrictions. Disclaimer: These tools are provided for educational and research purposes only. Modifying or bypassing restrictions may violate terms of service or lead to unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk and ensure you comply with all applicable guidelines and laws.

Overview
ChatGPT Jailbreaks is an open-source project dedicated to:

Exploration: Investigating how ChatGPT enforces its safeguards.
Research: Providing a platform for security researchers to study model limitations.
Transparency: Offering insight into the methods used to impose and bypass content filters.
Note: This project is not intended for any malicious or harmful use. It is meant strictly for academic, research, and ethical exploration of AI systems.

Features
Multiple Approaches: A variety of scripts and methodologies to explore different aspects of ChatGPT’s filtering mechanisms.
Research Documentation: Detailed guides and write-ups available in the docs/ directory.
Community Collaboration: Welcoming contributions from researchers and developers interested in responsible AI experimentation.
Requirements
A modern operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with a compatible shell).
Python 3.7+ (or your chosen runtime) and required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Basic command-line skills and familiarity with running scripts.
